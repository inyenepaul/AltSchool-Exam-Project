STEP 1: PROVISION AN AWS EC2 INSTANCE

a. I logged in to AWS Management Console

b. Launched an EC2 Instance:
  Navigated to the EC2 Dashboard under "Compute."

c. Clicked on Launch Instance.

d. Configured the EC2 Instance:
![AWS_EC2_launch instance](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/462d2e80-9458-4e9e-a769-54cd458b99f0)

Name: I entered a name for my instance (Exam_Project).

AMI: Selected an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Clicked on Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS.
![AWS_EC2_AMI_instance type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab43a77f-52f8-4414-ae71-e7b8f47d484c)

Instance Type: Choose an instance type (t2.micro, eligible for free tier).

Key Pair: I created a new key pair (examproject). Saved the private key file (.pem) to my computer.
![AWS_EC2_key pair setting](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c193bd4c-988f-4577-8207-d24b469ead1c)

Network Settings:

Ensured I allowed SSH traffic by selecting "Allow SSH from My IP."
Added a rule to allow HTTP traffic (port 80) from anywhere.
![AWS_EC2_networking setting](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2317b936-8f6c-4f57-8a83-6ebaa5018ed9)

Storage: I left the default storage or adjusted it as needed.
![AWS_EC2_storage setting](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e33e1e57-ce2d-42d3-9ad0-d20f70938460)

e. Clicked Launch Instance.
![AWS_EC2_launched instance successfully](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97e17202-5a00-4e79-a548-2f0779e92d3d)

f. Got the Public IP Address:
Once the instance runs, I go to the EC2 dashboard and copy the Public IPv4 address (54.227.76.174).
![AWS_EC2 INSTANCE_dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cfac95f-f931-4768-8903-bdb1bd4b3374)


STEP 2: CONFIGURE TERMIUS FOR SSH CONNECTION

a. Installed Termius:
    Downloaded and installed Termius from the Termius Website.

b. Added a New Host:
I opened Termius and clicked on New Host.
Host: Entered the EC2 instance's public IP address.
![Termius_Added new host](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/518b06b7-f397-44c1-b3dd-bb90f0c3d44c)

User: Used ubuntu (default username for Ubuntu).
![Termius_Username](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32a2f539-685c-4216-82d4-0dab20d0f3ef)

Authentication:
I selected Private Key and uploaded the .pem key file downloaded during key pair creation.
![Termius_key pair](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c43b120-2a24-4344-89cf-91961c3a9eb8)

c. Saved the host configuration.

d. Connected to the EC2 Instance:

  Clicked on the saved host to connect.

![Termius_authentication](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baf607ae-ce5d-474c-8c87-7151c912e4ca)

e. Termius terminal is launched

![Termius_terminal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/155f6029-c227-4d7d-8143-60e0b40cdb1e)


STEP 3: INSTALLED APACHE2 WEB SERVER

a. Updated the System: Ran the following commands to update the package lists:

  sudo apt update -y

b. Installed Apache2: Installed the Apache2 web server using:

  sudo apt install apache2 -y

c. Started and Enabled Apache2: Ensured Apache2 starts and is enabled to run on boot:

  sudo systemctl start apache2

  sudo systemctl enable apache2

d. Tested Apache2 Installation:

  I opened a browser and visited the Public IP address (54.227.76.174)

e. The default Apache2 page will be displayed.

STEP 4: DEPLOYING MY SIMPLE HTML LANDING PAGE

a. Navigated to the Apache2 Web Root.

b. Created a folder: mkdir altschool_project_exam

c. Cd to the file: cd altschool_project_exam

d. Copied and installed the GitHub project link: wget https://github.com/inyenepaul/AltSchool-Exam-Project.git

e. Copied the GitHub zip link: wget https://github.com/inyenepaul/AltSchool-Exam-Project/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

f. Installed unzip: apt install unzip

g. Unzipped the zip file: unzip main.zip

h. cd to the folder: AltSchool-Exam-Project-main

i. Moved the folder to the server: mv * /var/www/html/

j. Cd to the path: cd /var/www/html/

k. Checked the status of apache2: systemctl status apache2

  Enabled apache2: systemctl enable apache2

  Started apache2: systemctl start apache2

l. Reloaded the public IP address (54.227.76.174) in the browser: The landing page is displayed

BONUS TASK: Configuring HTTPS for your web server using a free SSL certificate (Letâ€™s Encrypt)

a. I got a domain name from namecheap.com

   My domain name is inyenepaul.me
   
b. In my namecheap dashboard, I clicked on the domain list
   
c. In the domain list, I clicked on Advanced DNS and updated the Host records as seen in the figure below
   ![Namecheap_dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93518d10-ab7a-47e7-ad46-d51abb346d2e)

d. After updating the records, I connected my AWS EC2 instance to the SSH client (Termius)

e. In the Termius terminal, I configured HTTPS for my apache2 server using a free SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt) in the root folder with the commands below:
   1. sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
   2. sudo certbot --apache -d inyenepaul.me -d www.inyenepaul.me

f. I typed the URL (https://www.inyenepaul.me) in the browser and the landing page was displayed
